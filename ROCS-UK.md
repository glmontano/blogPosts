## Let's Begin

The last two weeks bestowed the pleasure of learning about the UK's Renewable Obligation Scheme; specifically the fundamentals and market risks associated with trading certificates verifying compliance.

*What on Earth!? Trading what? Risk in what?*

In this post - I delve into the UK's mandate to reduce its carbon footprint, and the effect in creating demand and supply for a tradeable product.

## The United Kingdom

I've various fascinations with the United Kingdom. From its controversial kings, the castles beautifully held by the marvelous green lawns - the finely tuned British dialect and strong female figures from Queen Elizabeth I to Margaret Thatcher. You may even find my mornings glistering to the drums and fifes of the "British Grenadiers" in preparation for battle against the multitude of unread emails on Outlook.

Alas, my recent fascination - the UK's performance in reducing carbon emissions.

Below are the YoY percentage changes of a country's CO2 output. With the exception of the USA, I selected a comparable set of countries, striving to reduce their carbon footprint.

The graph, although convoluted in sight - highlights the UK edging ahead, with the best 10-year average of -2.78%

||AUS|CHN|FRN|GER|JPN|UK|USA|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|10-Yr Avg|0.1%|2.82%|-1.56%|-1.12%|-0.44%|-2.78%|-0.35%|

A round of applause, and now we ask the *how*.

## OFGEM and The Renewable Obligation Scheme

The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM) is an independent UK regulator striving towards a greener UK. One mechanism it mandates is the Renewables Obligations scheme to incentivise large-scale renewable electricity supply. Every MwH of non-renewable energy receives an obligation. At the end of the period (yearly) -  obligations are totaled and must be complied with.

There are 2 ways to comply: First - by generating renewable energy, where every MwH receives an obligation offset; Second is to pay a monetary amount, determined and paid to OFGEM.

### Renewable Obligation Credits

At this stage - *obligation* requires a little more abstraction to establish a measureable construct.
