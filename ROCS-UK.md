## Let's Begin

The last two weeks bestowed the pleasure of learning about the UK's Renewable Obligation Scheme; specifically the fundamentals and market risks associated with trading certificates verifying compliance.

In this post - I delve into the UK's mandate to reduce its carbon footprint, and the effect in creating demand and supply for a tradeable product.

## The United Kingdom

I've various fascinations with the United Kingdom. From its controversial kings, the castles held by the marvelous green lawns - the finely tuned British dialect and strong female figures from Queen Elizabeth I to Margaret Thatcher. You may even find my mornings glistering to the drums and fifes of the "British Grenadiers" in preparation for battle against the multitude of unread emails on Outlook.

Alas, my recent fascination - the UK's performance in reducing carbon emissions (no, not Brexit).

Below are the YoY percentage changes of a country's CO2 output. With the exception of the USA, I selected a comparable set of countries, striving to reduce their carbon footprint.

The graph, although convoluted in sight - highlights the UK edging ahead, with the best 10-year average of -2.78%

||AUS|CHN|FRN|GER|JPN|UK|USA|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|10-Yr Avg|0.1%|2.82%|-1.56%|-1.12%|-0.44%|-2.78%|-0.35%|

A round of applause, and now we ask the *how?*.

## OFGEM and The Renewable Obligation Scheme

The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM) is an independent UK regulator striving towards a greener UK. One mechanism it mandates is the Renewables Obligations scheme to incentivise large-scale renewable electricity supply. Every MWh of non-renewable energy receives an obligation. At the end of the period (yearly) -  obligations are totaled and must be complied with.

### Renewable Obligation Certificates

At this stage - *obligation* requires a little more abstraction to establish a measurable construct. Thus enters Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs), which are 'tangible' and measurable objects of compliance.

For compliance period beginning in April 2021 and ending March 2022 - every MWh of non-renewable energy in Great Britain receives an obligation of 0.492 ROCs. Said differently, every 2.032 MWh demands a single ROC.


### Obtaining ROCs

Thus far the idea of generating an obligation through ROCs has been presented. However, how does one *obtain* a ROC, and therefore meet their obligation? The answer is simple - supply renewable energy.

At the end of obligation period, every accredited supplier is required to deliver a number of ROCs to OFGEM. Alternatively, they may choose to  *buy out* their obligation at an OFGEM prescribed price per ROC.

The graph below illustrates the distribution of ROCs in 2 categories: (1) Those bought out; (2) Those presented.
