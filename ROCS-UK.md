The last two weeks bestowed the pleasure of learning about the UK's Renewable Obligation Scheme; specifically the fundamentals and market risks associated with trading certificates verifying compliance.

Get ready to have some fun - as we delve into the global issue of climate change, the Government's mandate to reduce its carbon footprint, and the effect in creating demand and supply for a tradeable product.

I've various fascintions with the United Kingdom. From its controversional kings, persistence on colonialism, the castles beautifully held by the marvelous green lawns - the finely tuned British dialect and strong female figures from Queen Elizabeth I to Margaret Thatcher. You may even find my mornings glistering to the drums and fifes of the "British Grenediers" in preparation for battle against in the multitude of unread emails on outlook.

Alas, my recent fascination - the UK's startling performance in reducing its carbon footprint.
