## Introduction

The last two weeks bestowed the pleasure of learning about the UK's Renewable Obligation Scheme; specifically the fundamentals of trading certificates of compliance.

In this post - I delve into the UK's mandate to reduce its carbon footprint, the effect in creating demand and supply for a tradeable product and some juicy market risk analysis.

## The United Kingdom

I've various fascinations with the United Kingdom. From its controversial kings, the castles held by the marvelous green lawns - the finely tuned British dialect and strong female figures from Queen Elizabeth I to Margaret Thatcher. You may even find my mornings glistering to the drums and fifes of the "British Grenadiers" in preparation for battle against the multitude of unread emails on Outlook.

And alas my newest fascination on the UK's performance in reducing carbon emissions.

Below are the YoY percentage changes of a country's CO2 output. With the exception of the USA, I selected a comparable set of countries, striving to reduce their carbon footprint.

The graph, although convoluted in sight - highlights the UK edging ahead, with the best 10-year average of -2.78%

||AUS|CHN|FRN|GER|JPN|UK|USA|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|10-Yr Avg|0.10%|2.82%|-1.56%|-1.12%|-0.44%|-2.78%|-0.35%|

But *how* is this happening?

## OFGEM and The Renewable Obligation Scheme

The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM) is an independent UK regulator striving towards a greener UK. One mechanism it mandates is the Renewables Obligation scheme to incentivise large-scale renewable electricity supply. Every MWh of non-renewable energy receives an obligation. At the end of the period (yearly) -  obligations are totaled and must be fulfilled.

### Renewable Obligation Certificates

At this stage - *obligation* requires a little more abstraction to establish a measurable construct. Thus enters Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs), which are pseudo-tangible and measurable objects of compliance.

For the period beginning in April 2021 and ending March 2022 - every MWh of non-renewable energy in Great Britain receives an obligation of 0.492 ROCs. Said differently, every 2.032 MWh demands a single ROC.


### Obtaining ROCs

So far the idea of generating an obligation through ROCs has been presented. However, how does one *obtain* an obligation offset, or a ROC? The answer is simple: supply renewable energy.

A supplier generating green energy - will receive a number of ROCs depending on (i) the technology used; (ii) the time accreditation; and (iii) the stationâ€™s installed capacity. For example in 2017 offshore wind generated 1.8 ROCs per MWh whereas onshore wind only gave 0.9.

### Fulfilling the Obligation

At the end of obligation period, every accredited supplier is required to deliver a number of ROCs to OFGEM. Alternatively, they may choose to  *buy out* their mandate at a prescribed price per ROC. These "buy-out" prices, starting from 2010, are shown below.

| Date          | 2010  | 2011  | 2012  | 2013  | 2014  | 2015  | 2016  | 2017  | 2018  | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |
|---------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Price | 37.19 | 36.99 | 38.69 | 40.71 | 42.02 | 43.30 | 44.33 | 44.77 | 45.58 | 47.22 | 48.78 | 50.05 | 50.80 |

The following graph illustrates how suppliers in a given year met their obligations by either (i) buying out; (ii) presenting ROCs.

It's clear that most obligations are met through ROC presentation. However, one may notice an increasing trend in the ROCs bought out. This may be attributed to decreasing compliance or the factual increases in the ROC rate per unit of non-renewable energy. Assuming stern views on a greener economy - the first case is ruled out.

### The Recycle Value

Taking one step back - it seems suppliers have 2 choices: (i) Pay to invest in a renewable source of energy; or (ii) buy-out their obligation. While both options are viewed as a cost - there is a monetary incentive to comply.

Suppliers may then be categorised into three groups:

1. Those who complied having at least as many ROCs as required
2. Those who did not comply and paid a cash amount equivalent to their ROC requirement
3. Those who did not comply, did not buy-out and made a late and enforced payment

Payments from (ii) and (iii) are pooled into a fund, and after netting administration costs are distributed to (i) on a pro-rata basis. This distribution per ROC is called the **Recycle Value**, and is the monetary incentive to comply.

The table below provides detail of this mechanism across the years. The first row is the pool of funds, the second is the number of ROCs provided by complying suppliers and the third is the recycle value.

|                       | 10     | 11     | 12     | 13     | 14    | 15    | 16    | 17     | 18     | 19     |
|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| Buy Out and Late (MM) | 324.00 | 358.00 | 123.00 | 164.00 | 42.00 | 25.00 | 0.00  | 460.00 | 604.00 | 842.00 |
| Num ROCs (MM) | 21.30  | 25.00  | 34.40  | 44.80  | 60.80 | 71.30 | 84.40 | 90.20  | 103.20 | 107.60 |
| Rec. Value            | 15.17  | 14.35  | 3.58   | 3.67   | 0.7   | 0.35  | 0     | 5.1    | 5.85   | 7.82   |

## The Value of a ROC

So far we've discussed that ROCs certify compliance, which without must be met with a payment at the buy-out price. Also - holders of ROCs not only satisfy their mandate, but receive a recycle value. Alas the question - what is the true value of a ROC?

Fundamentally, a good's worth is determined by the demand and supply. Demand does not refer to the OFGEM regulator as they are not paying for the ROC. Instead, demand and supply is the result of interactions between suppliers. To remove confusion, suppliers of renewable energy and ROCs *into the free market* will be called generators. This is an important point as a generator may hold on to their ROCs to verify compliance, and *if* they have excess ROCs may sell it into the free market. Suppliers demanding ROCs will maintain the name.

### The Importance of the Buy-Out Price

Assume there is no demand for excess ROCs. Then generators are left with a worthless certificate. Furthermore, assume there is demand but the market is oversupplied. Then there are more certificates in the market than required for the population of suppliers to meet their obligation. As such, unpurchased ROCs not only have a value of zero, but all ROCs generated will receive no recycle value. All these points will discourage suppliers from investing in green energy. As such, the buy-out price plays an important role of setting the market; it is the canvas that will be painted on, and must be appropriate for the painter.

The buy-out price was originally set at GBP 30.00, and designed to ensure excess demand of 10% (10% of suppliers will purchase ROCs from the free market). Thereon, the price grows at the [Retail Price Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail_Price_Index).

The main assumption in understanding the ROC's value is that there is excess supply, and demand. However, we will also consider a small deviation from equilibrium.
